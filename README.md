# Project Guard Dog: An Arduino Alarm
# &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Uses an ultrasonic sensor for detecting proximity)

<br /> 

## Description

Project Guard Dog uses the Arduino Uno to create an intruder detection system. It uses a touch 
sensor to arm and disarm the system and an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) to detect possible 
intruders. If an intruder is detected, the buzzer will sound with increasing frequency and a 
message will be written to the Serial Monitor.
